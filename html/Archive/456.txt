Special Containment Procedures:
Due to SCP-456's nature and capabilities, direct containment is currently impossible. The primary containment strategy for SCP-456 involves diplomatic engagement and compliance with their demands to prevent the release of deadly pathogens on Earth. Unauthorised communication with SCP-456 is strictly forbidden. In the event of SCP-456 initiating communication, Foundation protocols dictate immediate compliance with their requests to avert global biological threats.

Instances of SCP-456 have the capability to manifest physically on Earth, typically preceded by atmospheric anomalies, including columns of fire and the appearance of a glass chamber surrounded by opaque green gas. Security protocols are to be enacted immediately upon such manifestations to facilitate the transfer of demands and to ensure no interference occurs during these exchanges.

Description:
SCP-456 is a race of extraterrestrial entities of unknown origin, possessing a unique physiology and advanced capabilities. Instances of SCP-456 exhibit a tripartite structure, consisting of three distinct "heads" attached to a singular, central body via elongated necks. These entities tower approximately one foot taller than the average human adult. Despite their physical form, SCP-456's method of communication is primarily through the emission and reception of radio waves, enabling them to initiate contact with humanity from undisclosed locations. The translation process from human languages to SCP-456's own form of communication occurs in real-time, suggesting a highly advanced understanding of linguistic structures, although the mechanics behind this process remain a mystery.

SCP-456's in-depth knowledge of human biology and pathology is evident through their capacity to engineer and deploy diseases specifically designed to affect human populations. This ability has been historically linked to various epidemics and plagues, with SCP-456 believed to be responsible for the ████████ Plague, the █████ █████, and the ███████ ███, among others. However, since establishing direct contact with the Foundation, SCP-456 has refrained from releasing any new pathogens, provided their demands are met.

The demands made by SCP-456 have consistently involved the procurement of early adolescent children, threatening the release of a potent variant of the Indonesian influenza or other deadly pathogens should their requests be denied. The Foundation has complied with these demands to prevent large-scale biological catastrophes. The children supplied to SCP-456 have been sourced from various orphanages across partner nations, including ███████, ███████, ████ ████████ and ███ ██████ ██████, under the guise of international adoption programs. The selection process and the fate of these children post-handover remain largely unknown, as SCP-456 provides no information regarding their well-being or purpose, apart from that they will "Live Forever"

Instances of SCP-456 have demonstrated the ability to manifest physically on Earth, signaled by atmospheric disturbances followed by the sudden appearance of a glass chamber enveloped in opaque green gas. These manifestations allow for the physical transfer of demands and are closely monitored by Foundation personnel to ensure the swift and unobstructed compliance with SCP-456's requests.

Given the existential threat posed by SCP-456, primarily due to their potential to unleash unparalleled biological devastation, unauthorized communication with these entities is strictly prohibited. All interactions are handled with caution, under strict supervisions by the O5 Council, with the overarching aim of averting global health crises.

Addendum-456-A: During the latest encounter with SCP-456 on ██-██-████, an entity referred to as the SCP-456 Ambassador manifested in ██████, ██████ ███████, marking the most recent communication event between SCP-456 and the Foundation. The manifestation was characterized by the standard precursory signs, including atmospheric anomalies and the appearance of a glass chamber enveloped in opaque green gas.

In this encounter, SCP-456 issued a demand for ████ prepubescent children. After extensive deliberation and assessment of potential consequences, the demand was ultimately granted approval by the O5 Council, adhering to the established protocol of preventing a potential pandemic outbreak by complying with SCP-456's requests.

During the course of negotiations, the SCP-456 Ambassador provided previously undisclosed information regarding the fate of the children surrendered to SCP-456 in past transactions. It was revealed that these children are used by SCP-456 as a source of biochemical stimulation. The children are connected to the bodies of SCP-456 instances via a life support system designed to integrate the subject with the SCP-456 entity. This process allows the SCP-456 instance to derive pleasurable sensations from the biochemicals produced by the human subjects.
