    <h1><a href="003_Revisions/RevisionsList">SCP - 003</a></h1>
	<h2><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b></h2><p>SCP-003 is to be contained in a specially designed chamber within Site-[REDACTED]. The chamber is furnished with an array of pre-World War I era books. SCP-003 may request additional books, subject to approval to ensure no post-1914 information is included, as such information can induce a state of shock in SCP-003. The chamber is to be carpeted and equipped with a gramophone that continuously plays classical music, which has been found to soothe SCP-003's reported constant pain.

	SCP-003's chamber must be maintained to prevent decay or weathering of the statue. Although SCP-003 has not shown signs of physical deterioration, standard preservation procedures for stone artefacts are to be observed.

	All interaction with SCP-003 must be approved by Administrator Hank. Requests from SCP-003 for "Women of the Night" are strictly prohibited and to be denied under all circumstances.</p>

	<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>SCP-003 appears as a statue of a Caucasian male, origin unknown. Despite its stone composition, SCP-003 is sentient and capable of communication. SCP-003 claims to originate from a location referred to as "The Village," the nature and whereabouts of which remain unidentified.<br><br>

	SCP-003 was first documented as part of the Barnum and Bailey Circus, labeled "The Living Statue." In 18██, it was sold at auction to a private family, who later turned it over to the U.S. Government, eventually leading to SCP-003's containment by the SCP Foundation.<br><br>

	SCP-003 reports experiencing almost constant pain, alleviated to some extent by classical music and reading. It exhibits no biological functions such as blinking, breathing, or any signs of life beneath its stone surface. There is no evidence of cracking, chipping, or other forms of deterioration on SCP-003's surface.</p>

	<p><b>Addendum 003-A:</b> Interview logs and psychological evaluations indicate a complex mental state, likely resulting from SCP-003's unique condition and prolonged existence. Efforts to further understand SCP-003's origins and the nature of its consciousness are ongoing. SCP-003's knowledge appears limited to its experiences up to the early 20th century, necessitating careful control of information exposure to prevent psychological distress.</p>

	<p><b>Addendum 003-B:</b> SCP-003's requests for items or interactions are generally benign but must be carefully evaluated to maintain containment protocols and ensure SCP-003's psychological stability. Administrator Hank is responsible for the review and approval of all such requests.</p>

		<h2>Interview Log 003-A</h2>
	
		<p>Date: 18██-██-██<br>Interviewer: Dr. ███████<br>SCP-003</p>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> Good day. May I start by asking who you are?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> Well, you see, in the days of the circus, they all called me 'The Statue'. Never had a need for a real name, you know. Names are for people, and I... I've been more of an exhibit for as long as I can remember. It's a peculiar thing, not having a name.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> Interesting. And where do you come from?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> Oh, it was just a small village. Not much to it, really. The kind of place you might miss if you blinked while passing through. I wish I could recall the name, but it's like trying to catch smoke with your hands – it's there, but it slips right through.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> Can you tell me more about this village?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> It's all quite fuzzy, to be honest. Just flashes of memories, like looking at a picture through a fogged-up window. I've always been this way, as far as I know. Never been anything but this... statue.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> You were with a circus before. What do you remember from that time?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> The circus, yes. You know, there was a kind of charm to it, after a while. They'd parade me around, 'The Living Statue' they called me. It wasn't dignified, but it was home, in a way. They tried, in their own way, to make things comfortable for me. The ringmaster even had a violinist play for me once. It was... rather nice, despite everything.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> You've mentioned experiencing pain. Can you describe it?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> Ah, the pain. It's ever-present, like a constant companion. It's all over, but the chest, especially, feels like it's under a relentless siege. It's a dull, grating sort of agony, never quite letting up. Almost makes you wish for the ability to wince, you know?<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> Since you've been with us, you haven't slept or consumed any food or water. How do you sustain yourself?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> Ah, the mysteries of this existence. Never felt the need to eat, drink, or sleep. It's like those parts of me just... stopped, or maybe never were. I sometimes wonder what a good sleep would feel like, or the taste of food. But alas, such things are not for me. I simply exist, in this unchanging form.<br><br>

		<h2>Interview Log 003-B</h2>
	
		<p>Date: 19██-██-██<br>Interviewer: Dr. ███████<br>SCP-003</p>
		
		<h2>Begin Log</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> Good morning. Today, we're here to discuss more about your recent history, specifically how you came to be under government custody and subsequently to us.<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> Oh, yes, quite a journey it's been. It all started with those antique collectors. I was quite the curiosity, you see. Passed around like a rare trinket, but nobody really wanted to keep me. My nature, well, it was too much for them, I suppose. Eventually, I was auctioned off, found myself in the care of a family.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> Can you tell us more about this family?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> They were kind, in their way. Seemed to have a fondness for the odd and unusual. I suppose that's why they took me in. But living with a talking statue, it's not what most folks sign up for.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> How long did you stay with them before they handed you over to the government?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> Not long, maybe a few months. They quickly realized they were in over their heads. And so, off I went to the government.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> When the government obtained you, what did they do? Where did they keep you?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> They were mostly baffled, didn't quite know what to make of me. Kept me in a secure location, lots of coming and going, people staring, taking notes. It was a bit unsettling, to be honest.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> The government, with other priorities, has asked us to take long-term responsibility for you. Our foundation investigates and catalogs anomalies but hasn't traditionally housed them. You'd be our first long-term resident. How do you feel about that?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> Well, that's quite the honor, isn't it? To be the first. I've been shuffled around so much, a permanent home doesn't sound too bad. As long as I'm not just another exhibit, you know?<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> Of course. In that case, is there anything specific you'd want in your room? Anything to make your stay more comfortable?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> I do enjoy a good book, something to keep the mind occupied. And music, classical if you have it. It helps with the pain, you see. Makes it a bit more bearable. Beyond that, I'm not much for creature comforts, given my condition.
