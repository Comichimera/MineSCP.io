    <h1><a href="RevisionsList">SCP - 004</a></h1>
	<h2><b>Singular Confinement Protocols:</b></h2><p>SCP-004 resides within a locale of considerable remoteness, circumscribed by the Foundation under the pretence of a sanctuary dedicated to the conservation of nature. The environs surrounding this peculiarity are deemed off-limits to those not affiliated with the Foundation. Personnel of the Foundation charged with the stewardship of SCP-004 are enjoined to execute periodic scrutinies, ensuring the anomaly's constancy and delving into its peculiar attributes.</p>

	<p>The act of ascension upon, or any endeavour to physically engage with SCP-004, is strictly interdicted, owing to the enigmatic qualities of its gravitational and spatial characteristics. All inquiries into its nature are to be undertaken from a position of safety, necessitating that any apparatus employed in the study of SCP-004 be securely anchored and manipulated from afar.</p>

	<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>SCP-004 manifests as a portion of a crag's visage, measuring some 10 meters in breadth and 15 meters in stature, which finds itself estranged from the cliff's principal mass by a chasm of roughly 1 meter. This fragment hovers aloft, in stark repudiation of the established tenets of gravity and the physical sciences. The substance composing SCP-004 is indistinguishable from that of the adjacent crag, predominantly sedimentary rock in nature.</p>
	
	<p>No edifices or forces that might account for the buoyancy of SCP-004 have come to light. Endeavours to engage physically with SCP-004 have precipitated slight spatial anomalies, thereby obfuscating the veritable essence of its aerial suspension.</p>
