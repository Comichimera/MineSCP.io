    <h1>SCP - 002</h1>
	<h2><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b></h2><p>SCP-002 is to be contained in a specialized biohazard containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber is to be constructed with reinforced steel and equipped with an automated decontamination system. The interior of the chamber must be treated with an antifungal coating to prevent spore germination.

	Personnel entering SCP-002's containment area must wear HAZMAT suits with integrated bio-filters. All personnel must undergo a thorough decontamination process upon exiting the containment area. This includes ultraviolet light exposure, chemical showers, and a 24-hour quarantine period to ensure no spores remain on personnel or equipment.

	Surveillance cameras equipped with motion sensors are to monitor SCP-002 at all times. In the event of any movement suggesting an imminent blooming event, the containment chamber is to be flooded with a sporicidal agent to neutralize all spores released.</p>

	<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>SCP-002 is a species of bipedal, humanoid entities, approximately 2 meters in height, with a green, textured skin resembling moss or lichen. Previously believed to be self-destructive, SCP-002 has been reclassified following recent discoveries.<br><br>

	SCP-002's primary behavior involves a reproductive process termed "blooming." When SCP-002 detects motion, typically from living organisms, it initiates this blooming process. This process was initially mistaken for a self-destruct sequence due to the explosive dispersal of spores. The spores released during this process are capable of attaching to organic and inorganic surfaces, germinating into new SCP-002 entities.<br><br>

	These spores pose a significant biohazard risk. They have shown resilience to various environmental conditions and have the potential to germinate under a wide range of circumstances. The spores are microscopic and can remain dormant for extended periods before finding suitable conditions for growth.</p>

	<p>Research into countermeasures against SCP-002's spores is ongoing. Current priorities include developing a reliable method for detecting spores in the environment and creating an effective sporicidal agent that can be deployed rapidly in case of a containment breach or accidental exposure outside of containment.</p><br>
