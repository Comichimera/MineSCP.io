    <h1>SCP - 290</h1>
	<h2><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b></h2><p>SCP-290, now referred to as Dr. Scylla Korhonen in all Foundation documents except her SCP file, is granted significant liberties under Thaumiel classification. She is provided with living quarters within a secure Foundation facility and is allowed free movement within designated areas of the site. SCP-290 is permitted to participate in Foundation research under supervision, contributing to projects where her extensive knowledge of SCP entities and Foundation protocols is beneficial.
	Interaction with SCP-290 by Foundation personnel is to be conducted with professional courtesy, acknowledging her role as a researcher. SCP-290's access to sensitive information is monitored, and any research conducted is subject to standard security protocols. She is provided a salary for her contributions to Foundation research.
	SCP-290 is granted a non-networked computer for personal use, monitored by the Foundation's Ethics Committee. Requests for additional privileges or resources are to be considered on a case-by-case basis by the O5 Council.<br><br></p>

	<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>SCP-290 appears to be a human female in her early twenties, with no physical anomalies. She possesses comprehensive knowledge of all SCP Foundation documentation, including highly classified and redacted materials. This knowledge does not extend to documents not yet written or to the ability to read minds or predict future events.<br><br>

	Despite SCP-290's logical demeanour and extensive knowledge, she has demonstrated a profound emotional depth, indicative of a strong desire to understand her own identity and place within the Foundation. Interviews and interactions with SCP-290 reveal her to be highly in tune with her emotions, reflecting a nuanced understanding of the human experience, contrary to what might be expected from her anomalous knowledge.<br><br>

	SCP-290 voluntarily presented herself to Foundation personnel, requesting to speak with the organization. Her initial containment was governed by standard security protocols until the extent and nature of her abilities were understood. Subsequent interviews and evaluations revealed her non-hostile intentions and potential value as a Foundation asset. The decision to reclassify SCP-290 as Thaumiel and grant her researcher status was made by the O5 Council after extensive deliberation, reflecting a recognition of her unique abilities and the ethical considerations of her situation.<br><br></p>

	<h3>Addendum 290-A:</h3><p>SCP-290 has chosen the name Scylla Korhonen, under which she will be known in all non-SCP documentation. This decision was made in recognition of her individuality and her role as a Foundation researcher. Her choice reflects a significant step in her journey to understand and define her own identity beyond her SCP designation.</p><br>

		<h2>Out-Dated Containment Procedures</h2>
	
		<p>Item #: SCP-290<br>Object Class: Keter</p>
		
		<h2><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b></h2><p>SCP-290 is to be contained in a high-security containment cell at Site-[REDACTED]. The cell is to be monitored at all times via closed-circuit cameras, with no direct line of sight or physical access granted to any personnel without Level 4 security clearance. Interaction with SCP-290 is to be conducted through remote communication methods only.
		SCP-290's containment cell should be equipped with soundproofing measures to prevent any potential verbal leakage of sensitive information. All communication with SCP-290 is to be recorded and analysed for any breach of Foundation secrets.
		Given the nature of SCP-290's knowledge, a protocol for amnestic treatment is to be on standby in the event of an accidental or intentional breach of information by SCP-290.<br><br></p>

		<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>
		SCP-290 appears to be a human female in her early twenties. SCP-290 possesses an extensive and seemingly complete knowledge of all SCP Foundation documentation, including highly classified and redacted materials. The extent and origin of this knowledge are currently unknown.<br><br>

		SCP-290 was brought to the attention of the Foundation under unusual circumstances and immediately demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the Foundation's operations, containment procedures, and personnel information. The source of SCP-290's knowledge and the potential threat it poses to the Foundation's secrecy and security are of primary concern.<br><br>

		SCP-290's origin and how she came to possess her knowledge remain undetermined. She voluntarily presented herself to Foundation personnel, immediately displaying her knowledge of the Foundation's inner workings. Due to the potential threat posed by SCP-290's knowledge of classified information, she was classified as Keter and subjected to strict containment protocols to prevent any information leakage.
		</p>

		<h3>Addendum 290-A:</h3><p>Further investigation is ongoing to determine the nature of SCP-290's knowledge acquisition and any potential motives. The possibility of SCP-290 being a security breach or an information vector for external threats is being thoroughly explored. Until more information is ascertained, SCP-290 will remain under strict containment to mitigate any risks to the Foundation's operational security.</p><br>

		<h2>Secondary Containment Procedures</h2>
	
		<p>Item #: SCP-290<br>Object Class: Euclid</p>
		
		<h2><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b></h2><p>SCP-290 is to be housed in a secured living quarters within the designated Site Town, a residential area for Foundation personnel. The subject is allowed to move freely within the boundaries of the Site Town but is not permitted to leave the vicinity. The perimeter is to be discreetly monitored by Foundation security personnel at all times to prevent any unauthorized entry or exit. Communication with SCP-290 is to be conducted by personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Conversations and interactions are to be recorded and analysed to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently disclosed. Personnel are advised to refrain from discussing classified Foundation activities or details in the presence of SCP-290. Given SCP-290's unique knowledge, interviews and interactions should be approached with caution. Information provided by SCP-290 is to be cross-referenced with existing SCP documentation for accuracy and potential intelligence value.<br><br></p>

		<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>
		SCP-290 appears to be a human female in her early twenties, with no discernible physical anomalies. SCP-290 possesses extensive and detailed knowledge of all SCP Foundation documents, including those restricted to high-level personnel. This encompasses all current, past, and redacted documentation, but does not extend to future or uncreated documents.<br><br>

		SCP-290 lacks personal memories, including her name, age, or any details of her life prior to her appearance at a police station demanding to speak with the SCP Foundation. Her knowledge of the Foundation's operational details, personnel, and containment procedures is exhaustive and precise, to the extent of being aware of the content in documents as they are being written or revised.<br><br>

		SCP-290's origin and the means by which she acquired this knowledge are currently unknown. Psychological evaluations indicate no signs of deception or malign intent. However, the potential risk posed by her extensive knowledge of the Foundation's operations and containment protocols necessitates careful monitoring and containment.<br><br>
		</p>

		<h3>Addendum 290-A: Initial Encounter and Containment</h3><p>SCP-290 first came to the Foundation's attention when she presented herself at a local police station, insisting on speaking with Foundation personnel. The police, unaware of the Foundation's existence, contacted the Department of Homeland Security. Foundation agents were dispatched and confirmed SCP-290's extensive knowledge of classified Foundation information.</p>
		
		<h3>Addendum 290-B: Current Status and Ongoing Evaluation</h3><p>The O5 Council is currently deliberating on the long-term containment strategy for SCP-290. Her cooperation and lack of aggressive behaviour have allowed for her current semi-independent living arrangement within the Site Town. However, the potential risks associated with her knowledge necessitate ongoing evaluation and reassessment of containment procedures. SCP-290's unique understanding of SCP entities and Foundation operations could be of significant value to research and containment efforts. Efforts are underway to understand the source of SCP-290's knowledge and assess the potential benefits and risks of her cooperation with the Foundation.</p><br>

		<p>Date: [REDACTED]<br>Location: [REDACTED] Police Station<br>Interviewers: Foundation Field Agents Smith and Rodriguez<br>Subject: SCP-290</p>
		
		<h2>Begin Log</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Agent Smith:</b> Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Agent Smith and this is Agent Rodriguez. We're here to talk to you. You mentioned needing to speak with someone from our organization?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Oh, finally! You guys took your sweet time. Yes, I've got a lot to talk about. You know, all your secret stuff. Like SCP-002, the creepy green thing that explodes? Or SCP-283, that big blaze of fire. Sounds dangerous, huh?<br><br>

			<b>Agent Rodriguez:</b> [Looking confused] How do you know about these... entities?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> How? Well, it's like I've read every single document you've ever written. Every. Single. One. Even the ones you guys scrapped.<br><br>

			<b>Agent Smith:</b> [Exchanging a glance with Rodriguez] That's a pretty big claim. Can you prove it?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Sure. Let's see... SCP-666, the big lanky man, right? Creeps around and all that? I know literally everything about him and every other SCP you've got hidden away.<br><br>

			<b>Agent Rodriguez:</b> [Clearly unsettled] This is way above our paygrade. How are you doing this?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Beats me. I just woke up one day with all this in my head. Can't remember my own name, but I can tell you all about your top-secret anomalies. Weird trade-off, if you ask me.<br><br>

			<b>Agent Smith:</b> [Taking notes] Do you have any idea why you have this knowledge?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Nope. But it's all up here [taps her head]. Every containment breach, every experiment, every little detail about your Foundation. I don't know why, but I do.<br><br>

			<b>Agent Rodriguez:</b> Are you a threat to us? To the Foundation?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Threat? Nah. I'm just a walking, talking SCP encyclopedia. Don't plan on using it for anything bad. Just thought you guys should know someone out here knows all your secrets.<br><br>

			<b>Agent Smith:</b> We'll need to take you in for further questioning. There's a lot we need to figure out about you.<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Figured as much. Lead the way, agents. Let's see if you can keep up with what I know.

			<h2>End Log</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Post-Interview Notes:</b> SCP-290 was cooperative and exhibited no hostile intentions. Her extensive knowledge of classified SCP Foundation information is both a potential asset and a significant security risk. Immediate containment and further investigation are recommended. SCP-290's casual and confident demeanor, combined with her inexplicable knowledge, warrants careful monitoring and evaluation by higher-level personnel.

		<h2>Begin Log</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Site Director:</b> Good day, SCP-290. I'm the director of this site. We've brought you here for further questioning.<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Nice to meet you, Director. I already know a lot about you and this place.<br><br>

			<b>Site Director:</b> Let's get straight to the point. Do you possess any knowledge beyond what's documented by the Foundation?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Nope, I only know what's been written down in your documents. Nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>

			<b>Site Director:</b> Can you read minds? Know what I'm thinking right now?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> [Chuckles] I wish. No, I can't read minds. I just know what's in your files.<br><br>

			<b>Site Director:</b> [Takes out a piece of paper and writes something down] Can you tell me what I've written here?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> [Smirks] It's rude to call somebody a 'Spanner', Director.<br><br>

			<b>Site Director:</b> [Surprised] Remarkable... Now, you understand you're a significant liability. At first glance, you seem to be human with all normal human limitations. Why shouldn't we neutralize you right now?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Because I'm also a strong asset. Think about it – I can recall any information at any time. I'd make a pretty good researcher, don't you think?<br><br>

			<b>Site Director:</b> [Pauses] For now, you're free to move of your own accord within the Town. But be aware, we know how to handle perceived threats.<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> [Unfazed] I'm not scared. And I know how the Foundation operates. You don't like to hurt the 'Pretty Girls.'
			<h2>End Log</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Post-Interview Notes:</b> SCP-290 remains a complex entity. Her knowledge poses a significant security risk, yet her potential as an asset cannot be overlooked. The decision to allow SCP-290 limited freedom within the Site Town is a calculated risk, balancing the need for containment with the potential benefits of her cooperation. Constant monitoring and evaluation of SCP-290's behavior and interactions within the Site Town are crucial.

		<h2>Interview Log 290-C</h2>
	
		<p>Date: [REDACTED]<br>Interviewers: Dr. [REDACTED], Foundation Personnel<br>Subject: SCP-290</p>
		
		<h2>Begin Log</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> Good afternoon, SCP-290. How are you feeling today?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Oh, you know, it's a mixed bag. Every day is a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. One minute I'm marveling at this strange new world I'm in, and the next, I'm grappling with the loneliness of not remembering who I am. But overall, I'm hanging in there.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> Are you comfortable with your current accommodations?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Yes, they're surprisingly comfortable, almost too comfortable, you know? It's like I'm living in this bubble within the Foundation. Everything's provided for, but it still feels surreal, like I'm in a movie or something.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> How have you been adjusting to life here? Or does it not feel like an adjustment, given your situation?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> It's bizarre, really. I mean, what's there to adjust to when you don't remember anything else? This is all I know, yet it feels like I'm constantly trying to piece together a puzzle of a life I never lived. I guess you could say I'm adapting, but it's like learning to walk in a world where everyone else is sprinting.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> How have the regular Foundation personnel been treating you?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Oh, that's a story. Just a few days ago, a staff member came up to chat. You know, trying to be friendly. But it was awkward. Every time they shared something about themselves, all I could say was, 'Yeah, I know.' It's like my brain is a giant, unsolicited Wikipedia page on everyone here. It put them off, I could tell. They were just trying to make conversation, and here I am, unable to engage without spilling their life story back at them. It's isolating, in a way.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> Do you sense that some are scared of you and your abilities?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Absolutely. It's like I'm walking around with a sign that says, 'I know your secrets.' I can feel their unease. They smile, but their eyes are full of questions, maybe even fear. I wish I could just be 'normal' around them, but how can I be normal when I'm anything but?<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> Did the Foundation's reaction to your arrival meet your expectations?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Honestly, I didn't know what to expect. But being treated as an individual, not just an anomaly? That was surprising. I half expected to be locked in a cell and studied like a lab rat. So, in that sense, it's been a relief.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> What drives your desire to work as a researcher?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> I've got this vast ocean of knowledge in my head, and it feels like a waste to just sit on it. If I can help, if I can use what I know for something good, then maybe I can find some purpose in all this. Maybe it'll help me understand myself a bit better too.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> How have you been feeling mentally, both during and before your time here?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> It's been tough. There's this constant sense of loss, you know? Like I'm mourning a life I can't even remember. And then there's the overload of information – it's exhausting. Some days are better than others, but it's a lot to carry.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> Would you be interested in speaking with a mental health professional?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> I think I'd like that. Maybe talking to someone could help me sort through all these thoughts and feelings. It's a lot to process alone.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> How about a physical examination? To ensure there are no hidden anomalies.<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> That sounds reasonable. If there's more to me than meets the eye, it's probably best we find out.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> Is there anything you'd like to request from the Foundation? I can relay your message to the O5 Council.<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> Yes, a few things. A diary, for starters. I need a place to put down my thoughts, something that's just mine. And, if it's not too much, an actual salary for my work. It would help me feel more like a contributing member, less like a subject. And lastly, a real name. '290' just... it makes me feel less human. I want to be seen as a person, not just an SCP.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> I'll make sure your requests are heard. The Council will have the final say, but I believe your requests are fair.
			<h2>End Log</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Post-Interview Notes:</b> SCP-290's desire for personal identity and normalcy is evident in her requests and responses. Her willingness to undergo evaluations and her candidness in expressing her feelings and experiences offer valuable insights into her mental state and needs. These should be considered carefully by the O5 Council in their ongoing management and support of SCP-290.

		<p>Date: [REDACTED]<br>Interviewers: Dr. [REDACTED], Foundation Personnel<br>Subject: SCP-290</p>
		
		<h2>Begin Log</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> Good morning, SCP-290. I have some updates from the O5 Council. I'd assume you already know, but...<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> [Shaking her head] No, I don't. I only know what's documented. Mind-reading isn't in my skill set, much to everyone's surprise.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> [Taken aback] I see, that's... well, that's good to know. Let's get to it then. The Council has made some decisions regarding your requests.<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> [Leaning forward, eager] Please, go on.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> Firstly, they've agreed you can choose your own name. You'll be known as 'Researcher [Your Name]' in all our records, apart from your SCP file.<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> [Eyes widening, a mix of excitement and disbelief] Really? My own name? That's... that's incredible. It feels like I'm being seen, truly seen, for the first time since... well, ever. Thank you, this means everything to me.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> They've also agreed to provide you with a salary for your contributions.<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> [Smiling widely] That's more than I dared hope for. It's like I'm part of something, not just an anomaly to be filed away. I can actually make a difference, contribute on my own terms.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> Regarding the diary, they have some reservations. They're concerned about the potential for leaking sensitive information. So, they've denied a written diary for now. But, they're willing to provide a computer with no internet access, monitored by the Ethics Committee. Is that acceptable?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> [Sighs, a hint of disappointment in her voice] I understand their caution. It's not ideal, but it's a start, right? I'll take it. After all, considering what I know about the Foundation, I was bracing for much worse.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> I'm glad to hear that. And, if you've thought of a name...<br><br>

			<b>SCP-290:</b> [Thoughtfully] I'll need a bit of time. It's not every day you get to define yourself with a name, is it? It feels... liberating, yet daunting.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. [REDACTED]:</b> Take all the time you need. This is an important decision.
			<h2>End Log</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Post-Interview Notes:</b> SCP-290's reactions to the Council's decisions reveal a deep emotional response, reflecting her relief and gratitude for the unexpected leniency and recognition of her individuality. Her thoughtful consideration in choosing a name highlights her desire for a personal identity beyond her SCP designation. The Council's cautious approach, balancing SCP-290's needs with security concerns, seems to be met with understanding and appreciation, albeit mixed with some natural disappointment.
