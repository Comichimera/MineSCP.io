    <h1>SCP - 456</h1>
	<h2><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b></h2><p>Due to SCP-456's extraterrestrial nature and ability to manifest at will, physical containment is impossible. The only means of monitoring SCP-456 is by intercepting any radio communications that may be originating from SCP-456. A specialized task force, designated Sigma-9 ("Skywatchers"), is responsible for tracking SCP-456-related activities and ensuring readiness for any manifestation events.

In the event of SCP-456 communication or manifestation, the highest-ranking Foundation official available must engage with SCP-456 to fulfill their demands, with the goal of preventing the release of any pathogenic agents. All interactions with SCP-456 are to be recorded and analyzed to better understand their motives and capabilities.</p>

	<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>SCP-456 is a species of extraterrestrial entities capable of abducting human children under the age of 12 through unknown means. The method of abduction remains a mystery, as there are no witnesses, and the abductions leave no physical evidence. The existence of SCP-456 came to light following an incident where an entity, presumed to be a member of SCP-456, manifested in [REDACTED] to communicate with humanity. The entity's appearance was brief, and it managed to escape before any containment efforts could be enacted.</p>
	  
	<p>SCP-456 is described as having a tripartite head structure, with three "heads" emerging from a single body via elongated necks. Each head is reported to have features that are difficult to reconcile with terrestrial life forms, lacking identifiable sensory organs that would correspond to eyes, ears, or mouth as understood in Earth's biology. The purpose or function of these three heads, whether sensory, communicative, or otherwise, remains a matter of speculation.</p>
	<p>The entity's body is slender, particularly in the upper torso, tapering to what might be considered a base rather than legs, as no locomotive limbs were observed. Notably, SCP-456 appears to lack arms or any analogous appendages, raising questions about how it interacts with its environment or performs the abductions. Its height is estimated to be slightly over that of an average adult human, standing roughly a foot taller, which combined with its slender frame, imparts an imposing yet fragile appearance.</p>
	<p>The skin or outer covering of SCP-456 is described as smooth, with a reflective quality that made it difficult for witnesses to ascertain its color or texture definitively. This reflective quality might serve as a form of camouflage or might be indicative of its extraterrestrial origin, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation to environments or conditions vastly different from Earth's.</p>
	  <p>During its communication, the entity explicitly detailed that SCP-456 abducts human children to harvest chemicals produced by their bodies, which the entities use as a form of narcotic. According to the entity, these chemicals provide SCP-456 with euphoric effects. It was revealed that the abducted children are kept alive indefinitely in a state that allows for continuous chemical harvest. However, the efficacy of the chemicals diminishes over time, necessitating the abduction of more children to sustain their narcotic needs. The entity's disclosure was delivered with a tone of complete indifference to human societal norms, ethics, and the profound horror of its actions.</p>
	<p>Prior to the manifestation event involving an SCP-456 entity, the global rate of unexplained child disappearances was statistically within expected norms, accounting for variances due to non-anomalous factors. However, following the event, Foundation analysts observed a significant and sustained increase in the number of children under the age of 12 reported missing under mysterious circumstances worldwide. This uptick in disappearances did not align with any known pattern of human activity or previously documented anomalous activity.</p>
	<p>Following the manifestation event, all attempts to establish further communication with SCP-456 have failed. The Foundation has launched several initiatives aimed at understanding the technology or methods used by SCP-456 for their abductions, with the goal of developing countermeasures or a means of negotiation.</p>
	<p>Despite extensive research, surveillance, and investigative efforts, no viable means have been identified to predict or prevent the abduction of children by SCP-456. This inability to intervene or to even detect the presence of SCP-456 prior to an abduction event has necessitated its classification as Apollyon.</p>
