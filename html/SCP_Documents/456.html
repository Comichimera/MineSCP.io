    <h1>SCP - 456</h1>
	<h2><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b></h2><p>Due to SCP-456's extraterrestrial nature and ability to manifest at will, physical containment is impossible. The only means of monitoring SCP-456 is by intercepting any radio communications that may be originating from SCP-456. A specialized task force, designated Sigma-9 ("Skywatchers"), is responsible for tracking SCP-456-related activities and ensuring readiness for any manifestation events.

In the event of SCP-456 communication or manifestation, the highest-ranking Foundation official available must engage with SCP-456 to fulfill their demands, with the goal of preventing the release of any pathogenic agents. All interactions with SCP-456 are to be recorded and analyzed to better understand their motives and capabilities.</p>

	<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>SCP-456 is a race of extraterrestrial entities of unknown origin. Instances of SCP-456 are characterized by three distinct "heads" connected to a singular body via elongated necks. They stand approximately a foot taller than the average human. SCP-456 possesses the ability to communicate through radio waves but seems to understand human speech without such technology. The process by which they translate and understand human communication remains unknown.<br><br>

	SCP-456 has demonstrated a profound understanding of human anatomy and biology, evidenced by their capability to engineer and unleash unique strains of diseases. Historical analysis suggests SCP-456 may be responsible for various historical plagues, including the ████████ Plague, the █████ █████, and the ███████ ███.<br><br>

	Instances of SCP-456 have manifested on Earth, typically preceded by a column of fire descending from the sky and the appearance of a glass chamber filled with opaque green gas. Within this chamber, SCP-456 instances are barely visible and dematerialize upon departure.</p>
	
	<p><b>Addendum 456-A:</b> Due to the significant existential risk posed by SCP-456, all unauthorized communication with the entity is expressly prohibited. Communication with SCP-456 is to be strictly limited to designated Foundation personnel who have received the requisite clearance and training. Extreme caution is imperative during any form of interaction with SCP-456. Currently, compliance with SCP-456's demands is mandatory, as the Foundation lacks alternative contingency measures to mitigate the potential risks posed by non-compliance. The primary objective of the Foundation concerning SCP-456 has transitioned from containment to complete neutralization, reflecting the severity and uncontainable nature of the threat it presents.</p>
	
	<p><b>Addendum 456-B:</b> Each interaction with SCP-456 has been accompanied by progressively larger demands. There is growing concern within the Foundation that SCP-456 may soon request something beyond the Foundation's capacity to provide, potentially leading to a severe and uncontrollable plague event. Contingency plans are being developed for such a scenario, although the effectiveness of these plans against an entity of SCP-456's capabilities is uncertain.</p>
