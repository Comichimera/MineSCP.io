    <h1><a href="RevisionsList">SCP - 003</a></h1>
	<h2><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b></h2><p>SCP-003 is ordained to be sequestered within a chamber of special design, situated in the precincts of Site-██. This domicile is to be appointed with an assemblage of volumes, literary works of varied ilk, from which SCP-003 may petition further additions, pending the sanction of those vested with authority. Moreover, the chamber shall be adorned with carpeting and furnished with a gramophone, an apparatus set to perpetually disseminate the strains of baroque and classical music. This auditory ambience has been discerned to assuage the incessant afflictions of discomfort reported by SCP-003.</p>

	<p>It is imperative that the sanctum of SCP-003 be preserved against the ravages of decay and the elements, ensuring that the integrity of the statue remains inviolate. While SCP-003 has not manifested any overt signs of physical erosion, the procedures customary to the conservation of stone artefacts are to be meticulously observed, thus safeguarding the continuance of its condition.</p>

	<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>SCP-003 presents itself in the guise of a statuary effigy, depicting a male of Caucasian extraction, its provenance shrouded in mystery. Notwithstanding its petrified composition, SCP-003 possesses sentience and exhibits the capacity for communication. It avers its genesis from a locale denominated as "The Village," the essence and locality of which remain enshrouded in obscurity.</p>

	<p>The inaugural documentation of SCP-003 emerged from its association with the Barnum and Bailey Circus, where it was heralded as "The Living Statue." In the year of our Lord 18██, it transitioned ownership via auction to a private lineage, who subsequently relinquished it into the custodianship of the U.S. Government. This sequence of stewardship culminated in the encasement of SCP-003 under the aegis of the SCP Foundation.</p>

	<p>SCP-003 professes to endure a state of near-constant anguish, a condition which is marginally mitigated by the dulcet tones of classical music and the engagement with literature. It demonstrates none of the physiological hallmarks of life such as ocular motion, respiration, or any semblance of vitality beneath its lithic veneer. Notably, its exterior remains unmarred by fissures, erosions, or any manifestations of decay.</p>

		<h2>Interview Log 003-A</h2>
	
		<p>Date: 18██-██-██<br>Interviewer: Dr. ███████<br>SCP-003</p>
		
		<h2>Begin Log</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> Good day. May I start by asking who you are?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> Well, you see, in the days of the circus, they all called me 'The Statue'. Never had a need for a real name, you know. Names are for people, and I... I've been more of an exhibit for as long as I can remember. It's a peculiar thing, not having a name.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> Interesting. And where do you come from?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> Oh, it was just a small village. Not much to it, really. The kind of place you might miss if you blinked while passing through. I wish I could recall the name, but it's like trying to catch smoke with your hands – it's there, but it slips right through.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> Can you tell me more about this village?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> It's all quite fuzzy, to be honest. Just flashes of memories, like looking at a picture through a fogged-up window. I've always been this way, as far as I know. Never been anything but this... statue.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> You were with a circus before. What do you remember from that time?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> The circus, yes. You know, there was a kind of charm to it, after a while. They'd parade me around, 'The Living Statue' they called me. It wasn't dignified, but it was home, in a way. They tried, in their own way, to make things comfortable for me. The ringmaster even had a violinist play for me once. It was... rather nice, despite everything.<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> You've mentioned experiencing pain. Can you describe it?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> Ah, the pain. It's ever-present, like a constant companion. It's all over, but the chest, especially, feels like it's under a relentless siege. It's a dull, grating sort of agony, never quite letting up. Almost makes you wish for the ability to wince, you know?<br><br>

			<b>Dr. ███████:</b> Since you've been with us, you haven't slept or consumed any food or water. How do you sustain yourself?<br><br>

			<b>SCP-003:</b> Ah, the mysteries of this existence. Never felt the need to eat, drink, or sleep. It's like those parts of me just... stopped, or maybe never were. I sometimes wonder what a good sleep would feel like, or the taste of food. But alas, such things are not for me. I simply exist, in this unchanging form.<br><br>
