    <h1>SCP - 004</h1>
	<h2><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b></h2><p>SCP-004 is located in a remote area, cordoned off by the Foundation under the guise of an environmental protection zone. The airspace above SCP-004 is to be designated a no-fly zone, and the surrounding area is to be monitored for unauthorized personnel. Foundation personnel assigned to SCP-004 are to conduct regular inspections to ensure the anomaly remains stable and to study its properties.

	Climbing or attempting to physically interact with SCP-004 is strictly prohibited due to the unknown nature of its gravitational and spatial properties. All research must be conducted from a safe distance, and any equipment used to study SCP-004 must be securely tethered and remotely operated.</p>

	<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>SCP-004 appears to be a segment of a cliff face, approximately 10 meters in width and 15 meters in height, that is detached from the main body of the cliff by a gap of approximately 1 meter. This segment is suspended in mid-air, defying known laws of gravity and physics. The composition of SCP-004 is consistent with the surrounding cliff material, primarily sedimentary rock.<br><br>
	
	No supporting structures or forces have been detected that could explain the levitation of SCP-004. Attempts to physically interact with SCP-004 have resulted in minor spatial distortions, making it difficult to ascertain the true nature of its suspension.</p>

	<p><b>Addendum 004-A:</b> Geological surveys of the area surrounding SCP-004 have revealed no significant anomalies in the earth's magnetic field or gravitational pull. The floating segment appears to be a localized phenomenon.</p>

	<p><b>Addendum 004-B:</b> Initial drone explorations have shown that the underside of SCP-004 is as solid and unremarkable as its visible surfaces. The gap between SCP-004 and the main cliff does not appear to harbour any unusual properties, aside from the lack of physical connection.</p>
	
	<p><b>Addendum 004-C:</b> Long-term observation has confirmed that SCP-004 remains at a consistent altitude and orientation, suggesting a stable anomaly. Theories regarding its formation and suspension include localized spatial anomalies, gravitational manipulation, or unknown geological phenomena. Further research is ongoing to understand the potential causes and implications of SCP-004's existence.</p>
