    <h1><a href="RevisionList">SCP - 002</a></h1>
	<h2><b>Singular Confinement Protocols:</b></h2><p>SCP-002 shall be sequestered within a chamber wrought of iron, the strength of which is augmented by steel plates, each riveted for added resilience, situated within the confines of Site-██. This sanctum is to be furnished with an array of mechanical tripwires, each meticulously linked to charges of dynamite. These devices are arrayed with strategic acumen, their purpose being to effect the neutralization of SCP-002, should it seek to extricate itself from its bonds. The ingress to the chamber housing SCP-002 is to be strictly proscribed, save for those endowed with the authorization of Level 4 clearance.</p>

	<p>In the lamentable eventuality of an explosion within said chamber, it shall be incumbent upon all personnel to vacate the vicinity with alacrity. Subsequently, a reconnaissance of the damage, coupled with an evaluation of the breach in containment, shall be undertaken from a remove. This task shall employ telescopes and akin observational instruments, so as to gauge the state of affairs without succumbing to the perils of direct contact.</p>

	<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>SCP-002 presents as a genus of bipedal entities, humanoid in aspect, distinguished by a skin of an uncustomary verdant hue and textured semblance, standing at a stature of approximately 2 meters. The creature is notably bereft of sophisticated sensory organs and is observed to manifest behaviors of a rudimentary nature.<br><br>

	Most singular and perilous is the reactive behavior SCP-002 exhibits. Upon perceiving motion within a certain proximal range, commonly indicative of the presence of living entities, SCP-002 will activate a self-annihilation mechanism. This act precipitates an explosion of formidable potency, wreaking considerable havoc upon its environs. The precise mechanics underlying this explosive phenomenon remain an enigma, as SCP-002 is utterly obliterated in the course of the event, precluding the possibility of post-analysis.<br><br>

	Moreover, it has been observed that SCP-002 relinquishes any semblance of self-preservation upon triggering its explosive cadence, advancing towards the source of detected motion with a disregard for impediments or its own well-being. This conduct suggests the existence of an ingrained or programmed impetus, the genesis and aim of which are the focus of rigorous inquiry.</p>
