    <h1><a href="RevisionsList">SCP - 002</a></h1>
	<h2><b>Singular Confinement Protocols:</b></h2><p>Instances of SCP-002 are to be rendered inert forthwith upon discovery, this task falling to the purview of sanctioned containment or extermination detachments. These cohorts, when confronting SCP-002, are enjoined to preserve a safe remove of no less than 100 meters from any such detected entity. Moreover, they are vested with the authority to make use of distant firepower, be it through the agency of riflery or the deployment of artillery pieces.</p>

	<h2><b>Description:</b></h2><p>SCP-002 presents as a genus of bipedal entities, humanoid in aspect, distinguished by a skin of an uncustomary verdant hue and textured semblance, standing at a stature of approximately 2 meters. The creature is notably bereft of sophisticated sensory organs and is observed to manifest behaviors of a rudimentary nature.<br><br>

	Most singular and perilous is the reactive behavior SCP-002 exhibits. Upon perceiving motion within a certain proximal range, commonly indicative of the presence of living entities, SCP-002 will activate a self-annihilation mechanism. This act precipitates an explosion of formidable potency, wreaking considerable havoc upon its environs. The precise mechanics underlying this explosive phenomenon remain an enigma, as SCP-002 is utterly obliterated in the course of the event, precluding the possibility of post-analysis.<br><br>

	Moreover, it has been observed that SCP-002 relinquishes any semblance of self-preservation upon triggering its explosive cadence, advancing towards the source of detected motion with a disregard for impediments or its own well-being. This conduct suggests the existence of an ingrained or programmed impetus, the genesis and aim of which are the focus of rigorous inquiry.</p>
